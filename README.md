# CPP_for_gamedev

A collection of C++ lecture examples and code exercises for game development.

## 📚 Contents

- `lecture1/` – Code and notes for Lecture 1  
- `lecture2/` – Code and notes for Lecture 2  
- `main/` – Main project code folder  
- `students.txt` – Student list (or related metadata)  
- `.vscode/` – VS Code workspace settings (optional)

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

To compile and run the code:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shresthasameerman/CPP_for_gamedev.git
   ```
2. Change into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd CPP_for_gamedev
   ```
3. Navigate to the lecture folder you want (e.g., `lecture1/`) and compile the .cpp files. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o lecture1
   ./lecture1
   ```
4. Explore the code, make changes, and run them to see how things work.

## 🎮 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide clear, simple C++ examples tailored for game development.
- Walk through key concepts (setting up projects, basic engine loops, etc.).
- Serve as a learning resource or foundation you can build your own games from.

## 🛠 Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (e.g., g++, clang++)  
- (Optional) A code editor or IDE of your choice (VS Code, etc.)  
- The code is cross‑platform, but examples were developed on *nix (Linux/Ubuntu) environment.  

## ✍️ Usage

- Browse through each lecture folder to find code examples and notes.  
- Modify the code to experiment with changes (e.g., game loop timing, input handling).  
- Use the repository as a reference when starting your own game‑development project.

## 🙏 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to:
- Add new lecture examples  
- Improve the code or comments  
- Fix bugs or clarify explanations  
…then feel free to fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
